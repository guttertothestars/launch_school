Sum of Sums
Write a method that takes an Array of numbers and then returns the sum of the
sums of each leading subsequence for that Array. You may assume that the Array
always contains at least one number.

Examples:
sum_of_sums([3, 5, 2]) == (3) + (3 + 5) + (3 + 5 + 2) # -> (21)
sum_of_sums([1, 5, 7, 3]) == (1) + (1 + 5) + (1 + 5 + 7) + (1 + 5 + 7 + 3) # -> (36)
sum_of_sums([4]) == 4
sum_of_sums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 35

def sum of sums(numbers)
  sum_total = 0
  accumulator = 0

  numbers.each do |num|
    accumulator += num
    sum_total += accumulator
  end

  sum_total
