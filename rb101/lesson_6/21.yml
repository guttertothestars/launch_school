  Welcome to Twenty One!
  Twenty One is a stripped down version of Blackjack. Just as in Blackjack,
  the goal of this game is to get as close as 21 as possible without going over.
  Rules:
  - You are the Gambler and will play against the Dealer.
  - Starting with the Gambler, each player is dealt two cards.
  - The Gambler can see their cards, but may only see the Dealer's first card.
    The Dealer's second card (the hole card) is hidden from you.
  - The value of each player's hand is the sum of all cards in their hand.
  - Cards 2-10 are worth their face value.
  - Jack, Queen, King are worth 10.
  - Ace may be worth 1 or 11, depending on which value is favourable to the
    player. Meaning that the Ace is worth 1 if the player's hand would have
    exceeded 21 with a high ace.
  - Hit means the player asks to be dealt another card.
  - Stay means the player choses to finishes their turn.
  - Bust means the player's hand exceeds 21.
  Order of Play:
  - Gambler is dealt a card.
  - Dealer is dealt a card.
  - Gambler is dealt a card
  - Dealer is dealt a card (hidden).
  - If the Gambler has a hand worth 21, they win, unless the Dealer also has a
    hand worth 21. If both players have 21, the round ends in a tie.
  - Gambler decides to hit until they decide to stay, or if they bust.
    Gambler loses the round if they bust.
  - Dealer hits until 17 or greater, or if they bust.
    Dealer loses the round if they bust.
  - The highest hand wins if no one has busted, and all players have stood.
  - The round is tied if the hands are worth an equal value.
  - The player who first wins 5 rounds is declared the winner of the game.
