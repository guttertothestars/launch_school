welcome: "Welcome to 21!"
dealer: 'The dealers hand is worth '
rules:  |
  -You start with a normal 52-card deck consisting of the 4 suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades)

  -The deck includes 13 values (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king, ace).

  -all of the card values are pretty straightforward, except for the ace. The numbers 2 through 10 are worth their face value.
   The jack, queen, and king are each worth 10, and the ace can be worth 1 or 11.
   The ace's value is determined each time a new card is drawn from the deck.

  -The goal of Twenty-One is to try to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. If you go over 21, it's a "bust" and you lose.
  -The game consists of a "dealer" and a "player". Both participants are initially dealt 2 cards.
   The player can see their 2 cards, but can only see one of the dealer's cards.
  -Player turn: the player goes first, and can decide to either "hit" or "stay". A hit means the player will ask for another card.
   If the total exceeds 21, then the player "busts" and loses.

  -Dealer turn: when the player stays, it's the dealer's turn.
   The dealer must follow a strict rule for determining whether to hit or stay: hit until the total is at least 17.
   If the dealer busts, then the player wins.

  -Comparing cards: when both the player and the dealer stay, it's time to compare the total value of the cards and see who has the highest value.
   If both the dealer and player have the same value in their hands, it is a tie.
